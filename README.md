# Consolidated Tabs

This plugin will allow you to combine the selected tabs into a single tab as draggable and resizable panels.

**Note:** Initial positioning and sizing can be a little tricky due to the snapping feature between panels. You may have to move/resize and refresh the page a couple of times to get everything perfectly aligned. Once you're happy with the positions and sizes you should not have to mess with them again.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

## Settings

* Combined Tabs Order: all the tabs that will be combined into one tab as draggable and resizable panels.
* Uncombined Tabs: tabs that have not been combined and will remain as their own tab.
* Resize Navbar: whether to resize the width of the top navbar to 100% or not.
* Remove Tab Name: don't show the name of the consolidated tab, only possible if all tabs are combined.
* Overall width: width to set the overall page container, useful for widescreen displays.
* Clear All Positions and Sizes: use the buttons to clear any position or size customizations, helpful when panels get moved off screen.
