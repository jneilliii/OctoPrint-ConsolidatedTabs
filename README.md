# Consolidated Tabs

This plugin will allow you to consolidate any OctoPrint tab into a single Consolidated Tab as a draggable and resizable panel. Click the screenshot below to see an example YouTube video. Since version 1.0.0 the plugin utilizes [gridstack.js](https://gridstackjs.com/) for positioning and sizing.

- **Resize Navbar:** whether to resize the width of the top navbar to 100% or not.
- **Remove Tab Name:** don't show the name of the consolidated tab, only possible if all tabs are consolidated.
- **Use Full Width of Browser:** if enabled the tab area will be sized to fit the entire width of the browser, and the sidebar will be moved to the left.
- **Enable Floating Panels:** if enabled the panels will not auto collapse into available open space. Can be helpful when panels are jumping around a lot.
- **Don't Show Instructions:** if enabled the instructions will not be displayed when enabling edit mode.
- **Don't Show Edit Button:** if enabled the edit button in the navbar will be hidden.

## Tips

- The name of the tab will match what is configured in OctoPrint's `Title` appearance setting.
- It's best to consolidate the desired tabs first and save, reload, and then enable edit mode again to resize and position.
- Panels will become full width automatically and realign once the tab's area width drops below a certain size.

## Themeify

If using Themeify you may want to add extra settings to your Advanced options. These are the relevant css selectors that you can adjust.
